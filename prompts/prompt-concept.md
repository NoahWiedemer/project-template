The application is used for chaining LLM's together and storing prompts easily and organized, so the user has a library of prompts that he can categorize he can create folders. He can share them with other users. He can login to see his own data. There is also a landing page that advertises the product and communicate well to the user what the product is about and what benefits it could bring to him. define all sub screens off the landing page. The prompt library of the user enables him to also store multiple prompts in one prompt so that the prompts are basically chained together. the user can either create new prompts and just write one prompt into them then he can add keywords and all kinds of other organizing stuff to it to keep track of this prompt but then he can also add prompts where he adds multiple steps to a prompt, and within a prompt in the result of another prompt can be linked and then the user has an execution button in every prompt but he can also go to a screen where he can chat with one selected prompt so the way this works is the user input the first prompt, or sometimes there is multiple input, depending on the prompt the user has selected and when the user submitted his inputs, the LLM chain will be executed, and if some of them have been linked to each other so that the result of one LLM goes into another, they will be executed after each each other to pass the content from one LLM to another. also there should be a community that shares prompts. Also, the user has to have someplace where he at his API keys and the user has always the possibility in every single prompt even in the sub prompts of a prompt he can define which model to use the default is always open AI GPT4o mini.
