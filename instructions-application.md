This is the description about the application DocCase:

This is part of the concept for Doccase an app/webapp to play medical cases. Every case gets a backstory and consists of different stages. Dark case is an application for people who want to either learn something about medical cases or they want to educate themselves and have some fun. Meanwhile, it's a fun way learning about different diseases and how you can work against them and what symptoms they have and it's done in a really enjoyable way where first the case is introduced to the/user and then he interacts with the patient and he can ask for certain things for example have you been into a vacation in the last two weeks to then think of follow-up questions or things that might have to do something with the symptoms so the player basically tries to find out what the patient has and in the end the player has to make a diagonals so to name the problem the patient has and after that there's another step where he like says how this could be treated like medication or different therapies or just recommendations like resting or whatever and then in the end the player can finish the case and then he gets a score based on all the different stages and how he did for example, making a wrong diagnose gives a worse score and the user has a bunch of cases in the app and each app are now each case has a category. The user can see what cases he already completed. There is a settings page where the language can be selected, and the theme of the application can be so light and dark mode and then the site also has a footer with impressment data privacy, and there is a logo in the header and also in the footer
